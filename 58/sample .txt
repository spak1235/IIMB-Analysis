[Speaker 2]
Ratika, tell me one thing, you like shopping a lot, right? Why do you keep asking me the same question? You know, I love shopping.

Yes, just like you love shopping, I love asking questions from you. And I think I am not the only one who likes shopping. There are many people who like shopping.

Yes, that's true. But if I tell you that the shopping you are doing is helping someone or because of your shopping someone's talent is coming in front of the country and the world, then?

[Speaker 3]
What could be a better thing than this? And I know this opportunity is given to us by ONDC, that is Open Network for Digital Commerce.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, ONDC, Open Network for Digital Commerce, where there are so many options, there is no shortage of options.

[Speaker 3]
The first choice of buyers and sellers, your goods reach you, absolutely safe.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, so we have to know about ONDC, right Ratika?

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
And you have to know about so many offers and discounts.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes, yes.

[Speaker 2]
So to share all this information, we have with us in the studio, Mr. Ajay Kashyap, Growth Manager, Beauty & Personal Care, ONDC. Namaskar Sir, welcome to Didi Morning Show.

[Speaker 3]
Namaskar, welcome to Didi Morning Show. Thank you. So nowadays, buyers and sellers both use ONDC.

So how is it beneficial for both?

[Speaker 1]
That's a very good question. Before I tell you this, I would like to understand how ONDC works.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 1]
So in today's time, all the websites that do e-commerce, there are three types of big business processes. In which, on one hand, you buy goods, different sellers buy their goods. On the other hand, there are customers who come to a platform to buy that goods.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay. Right.

Okay. Right. Right.

Right. Right. Right.

[Speaker 2]
Right.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Right. video commerce is very popular.

So today, through ONDC, we can do video commerce on the network. You use WhatsApp a lot. So in the future, you can find your shopping experience on WhatsApp as well.

Similarly, if you want to, AI is very popular. So in AI, we are going in that direction that through AI, we can increase our shopping experience. So these are some things that we are putting on the network right now.

And in the future, we will see their use on our applications.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely. Now, people who live in remote areas, so how can they take advantage of this shopping revolution?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, definitely. So today, as you know, in India, compared to other countries, the retail business, e-commerce is about 7% in retail. And compared to other countries, it is very low.

Like if we look at China or the US, it is around 25 to 30%. So what is the problem in this? The problem is that today our digital literacy is very low.

So where you talk about buyers and sellers who come from remote areas, through NSA, we have started an ONDC academy. Okay. Okay.

Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
How to select from that?

[Speaker 1]
Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Right.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you.
