Sometimes, we don't have much time to prepare for Diwali. We can't spend much time in the market. So, can we shop online?

[Speaker 3]
For online shopping, ONDC can help you. It stands for Open Network for Digital Commerce.

[Speaker 2]
Everyone likes to shop during festivals. But sometimes, there is a shortage of time. Sometimes, you get busy with some other work.

Sometimes, you can't shop in the market. So, what can you do? You can shop online.

You can get support from ONDC. Today, we are going to talk about ONDC. We have an expert with us.

Let's welcome him. Namaskar, we have Ashish Malik with us. You are the category head of health and wellness at ONDC.

[Speaker 3]
Ashish ji, first of all, Happy Diwali to you.

[Speaker 1]
Happy Diwali to all of you and to all our viewers.

[Speaker 3]
Since it is Diwali, what is ONDC? How can ONDC help us in this festive season?

[Speaker 1]
First of all, I would like to say that you have made a festive atmosphere here. There are different colours, flowers, Rangoli. It feels like Diwali is happening here.

ONDC is the first step of the Government of India. We want everyone to be able to connect with e-commerce. We are trying to make it a political effort.

We are trying to make it a political effort. So that small vendors, local to local, neighbourhood stores, grocery stores, small shops, can all take part in e-commerce. And can take advantage of it.

If you see, e-commerce is available only to very limited people. We want everyone to get this benefit.

[Speaker 2]
Mr. Ashish, sometimes it happens that we go to the market and buy things. But we remember some small things at the last moment. That one diamond is missing.

Or something is missing. Will we get all these things on ONDC?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, definitely. You see, we have enabled many categories. From where you can buy things.

Whether you want to buy clothes, you can buy that. Whether you want to buy electronics, you can buy that. Whether you want to buy household items for Diwali, you can buy that.

Whether you talk about health and wellness, you can buy health and wellness products. We just heard about Ayurveda. Plus, how important health is.

And today, pollution has also increased. So you can buy preventive products. Plus, if you have any problem, you can buy products for that too.

[Speaker 2]
That means, Ayurvedic medicines are also available.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely. DD Morning Show's Friday edition focusses on health. And because you are the head of health and wellness category, so tell us, which products and services are available in this category?

[Speaker 1]
So, first of all, we have made products available. And in products, you have many categories of products. So, if you talk about Ayurveda products, baby care products, mother and child products.

Plus, you will see, the season is changing. So, cough and cold is increasing. So, there are such products to prevent it, to increase your immunity.

Plus, if you have cough and cold, then how will you deal with it? How will you treat it? Its products are also available.

[Speaker 3]
So, all these products are non-prescriptive.

[Speaker 1]
There is no need for a doctor's prescription. Absolutely, you are absolutely right. These products are OTC, over-the-counter products.

Those who do not need a doctor's prescription, you can order them. And they will reach you as soon as possible.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, as a buyer, if I talk, whenever I shop online, one question comes to my mind. Is it authentic or not? So, whatever you get on ONTC, is it authentic or not?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, this is a very good question. In this, you see, who is this seller? So, there are sellers of different categories.

One is pharma companies, which are manufacturing the companies. Plus, there are D2C brands, which are new brands, direct to consumer. They have brought their products.

Plus, your neighbourhood, local for local. Those are the stores from which you already buy. But those stores, for the first time, can connect with e-commerce.

You see, one store can deal with 2 or 3 customers at a time. But now, through ONTC, they can take 100 orders at a time. So, they have a very good way Yes, absolutely.

[Speaker 3]
So, as Mr. Ashish said, this time, at Deepavali, adopt local for local, and get a chance to feature at Doordarshan. So, we will share that photo on But, let's say, there is a small shopper. He makes lamps, candles, any small product.

How does he register at ONDC? Does he go to ondc.org website?

[Speaker 1]
What will be the process? Yes, you are absolutely right. He can come to ONDC through a seller application.

He can go to ondc.org website. It is already written there what the procedure is. What steps he will have to take to come to ONDC.

Plus, he can contact other seller applications who can help him to come to ONDC. He can digitise his product list and bring it to ONDC.

[Speaker 3]
So, you are saying that there is a big seller aggregator who can help him in these small industries.

[Speaker 1]
That is also a way for him. And he can connect to ONDC as soon as possible. He can show his products in digitised form with photos and description.

And as the visibility of his product increases, he will be able to see and increase his business.

[Speaker 3]
You are an expert in technology. Let's say, there are some photos in that small industry. Nowadays, everyone can make a website.

So, how will you integrate that website with ONDC?

[Speaker 1]
As you said, there are some aggregators who already have tools. If the catalogue is in digitised form, he can come to ONDC as soon as possible. Plus, he can get a dashboard to see the order he gets.

So, he can fulfil the order. He can send the product to his customers as soon as possible. So, the seller is happy.

And the one who is getting the product as soon as possible is also happy.

[Speaker 3]
Customers like Bhavna, they don't have to go to ondc.org.

[Speaker 1]
Where do they have to go? They can go to ondc.org. They can choose the category of the product.

They can see the category of the buyer applications. Plus, if you are in a Play Store or on Android or Apple, you can go to Play Store or App Store and type ONDC. You will get all those buyer applications where ONDC is visible.

These buyer applications are already connected with ONDC. And through these, you can see and buy products of different categories.

[Speaker 2]
Wow, this is a very good thing that you can purchase Yes, and especially products of the health and wellness category because they are connected with our health.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you so much for coming and sharing how ONDC is connecting with our lives. Thank you so much.
