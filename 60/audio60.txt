[Speaker 5]
Welcome to my lecture, today I am going to talk about digital platforms.

[Speaker 2]
Digital platforms have made our life so much easier, they have proved to be so beneficial for businesses. And if these digital platforms get an open network like ONDC, then what to say. ONDC is not only making it easier for customers and sellers, but also for service providers.

[Speaker 3]
And with us today is Lead Communications ONDC Sujaya Jacob, with whom we will get to know what ONDC is, how it works, and how it is helping women entrepreneurs to grow their businesses.

[Speaker 2]
Sujaya ji, welcome to the show. First of all, in simple words, what is ONDC?

[Speaker 1]
I think what you have said about ONDC, you have said it very well. Because it is a network, not an app, not a platform, it is a network. What do we understand from a network?

A network connects businesses and customers. It is a technology that enables access, exposure and connectivity.

[Speaker 3]
How does ONDC work for women entrepreneurs?

[Speaker 1]
Not only for women, but for all small and rural businesses, it is a low commission model. You can connect with your network participants, and you can onboard your products, services and skills, and you can sell it. Today, platforms are very expensive and they have made a very hard core structure.

And this network connects with an open network and can communicate with each other in an open way.

[Speaker 2]
Sometimes, businesses are interrelated. For example, if I make a product, and someone else provides services to deliver the product, can our businesses also come to your platform through an open network?

[Speaker 1]
You are absolutely right. Your contribution, your product, my service, we can come together on a platform and create a mutually beneficial stream through an open network.

[Speaker 2]
We just talked about women entrepreneurs. Are there any success stories that you would like to share with our viewers?

[Speaker 1]
Actually, there are many. We don't have much time. But I am very excited.

I would like to give 2-3 examples. One is Kanjivuram. Kanjivuram Weavers is very famous.

Kanjivuram Weavers joined us a year ago. Kanjivuram's reach was very limited. The Weavers were not able to reach.

And today, they have ordered in more than 80 cities. And these are straight from the Weavers. So, this is a craft from rural India that is now reaching all across India.

So, that's really exciting. And this is just one of the examples. There are many more.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. Thank you, Sujaya ji. Thank you for coming to the DDMorning Show.

Thank you for sharing all these things with us. Thank you.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you so much. Thank you.
