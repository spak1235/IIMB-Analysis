Let's know about Open Network for Digital Commerce, or ONDC.

[Speaker 2]
Ratika, I know you are a big foodie. Yes, of course. So tell me one thing, what is it that makes you feel like the food you eat is not satisfying?

[Speaker 3]
Simple, no matter how many items I have in my stomach, but if there is no chutney or pickle in it, then I don't enjoy eating it.

[Speaker 2]
I think our viewers are also relating to this. And these are Indian spices, because of which our country has a unique identity in the world.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely, and we say that our country is a country of diversity, where there are rivers, mountains, trees, plants, and a lot of tasty food too.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, so when we talk about diversity, you mentioned chutney and pickle, so there is a long list of chutney and pickle. Yes, and listening to this, my mouth is watering. This is in everyone's mouth.

And in this, a lot of our entrepreneurs have done business, and have taken the country to a new level.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely, and one of those entrepreneurs is with us today in the studio, whose name is Aditya Bhargav, who is a registered seller on ONDC. You are very much welcome to DD Morning Show.

[Speaker 1]
Good morning.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, you are very much welcome to our program. So, because we are talking about chutney and pickle, so let's start with this, what is your business? Tell us more about your business.

[Speaker 1]
So, I am the founder of The Little Farm Co. We are a company that makes Jaivek pickle. How are we different from other brands?

First of all, we grow our own fruits. If it is mango pickle, we grow our own mangoes. If it is chili pickle, we grow our own chilies.

We don't add any preservatives or artificial colors to it. Our workforce is 70% women. So, our mission is to give you that pickle that reminds you of your grandmother.

Basically, India is a country where people buy pickles for breakfast, lunch and dinner. People buy pickles in all three meals. And you will find a bottle of pickle in every house, whether it is bought from the market, whether it is made by someone's grandmother, aunt, uncle or aunt, which is a seasonal special.

[Speaker 2]
So, you talked about grandmothers and grandfathers. This reminds me that the flavor of grandmothers and grandfathers when they used to make pickles was very strong. So, how do you maintain that flavor?

And there are different people, different choices. How do you know that people will like this flavor?

[Speaker 1]
See, first of all, cooking is an art. It is not just cooking. It is not a simple task.

So, we are not adopting that art to the next generation. So, we have to give them the same thing at convenience. By sitting at home online, they get the taste of their grandmothers.

Now, how are we preserving it? First of all, we still add all the pickles by hand. We do not use any machinery.

We add the pickles in big batches. We use pure mustard oil. We do not use any other oil in our production process.

We grow our own spices. So, it is exactly the same process that grandmothers used to make. Plus, it is a time-consuming process.

We do not take any shortcuts. We dry the pickles in the sun for 8-10 days. We make the pickles according to the season.

Basically, you will get Banaras red chili pickle at home. Or Gujarat's mango pickle. Or Punjab's cauliflower pickle.

Which is everyone's favorite in winters. So, our vision is that wherever you sit at home in India, you will get that state's, your grandmothers' special pickle.

[Speaker 3]
You know, Simran, I have been eyeing that pickle jar for a long time. That container is very close to our hearts.

[Speaker 2]
It is a big container. It is also close to us.

[Speaker 3]
Don't worry. Jokes apart, how did you register yourself at ONDC? How much time did it take you?

Can an ordinary person register easily?

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. Through ONDC, it has become very easy for anyone to sell online. To register at ONDC, simply go to any search engine and search ONDC.

You will find the option of Register as a Seller on their website. You can fill their form there. What do you need?

Your name, the company's name, your name. Whether you are the owner, proprietor, or a partnership. What kind of company is yours?

Is it private limited? You need a GST certificate because you have to sell goods. And your PAN number.

This is all you need. As soon as you upload this, after a few hours, you will get a confirmation from their team that your documentation is complete or if they need anything else. After that, they help you to catalog your products.

Cataloging means you can list the details of each photo and description of your products and the price at which you want to sell it through the platform. If this is not available to you easily, there is an option of WhatsApp where their team will guide you step-by-step on WhatsApp on how you can list them. They will literally support you in every step and complete the process for you.

[Speaker 2]
It is so easy. Absolutely. You can also register yourself.

I will think about it. When we talk about ONDC, our viewers must be wondering why did you choose ONDC? What kind of additional benefits do you see in this?

[Speaker 1]
As I said, we are only an online seller. We think that online is the future in terms of increasing our reach. We started with Delhi NCR.

What is easy for me is that I am serving my warehouse in Delhi to someone in Chennai. I don't have to focus on marketing. I am getting new customers through the same platform.

Someone in Chennai, someone in Jharkhand, someone in Orissa, someone in Mumbai, someone in Madhya Pradesh. People are looking at your products from different places and ordering them. As a business, I haven't reached the point where I can focus on marketing.

But I am getting additional customers through this. I never thought that my customers would be sitting there.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 1]
So that is a big advantage. We also get validation from the customers that if the people there like our pickle, then we have a scope to go international in the future.

[Speaker 3]
As you said, your products are going to different places. How do you ensure that your product reaches different places? You said it is reaching MP, UP, everywhere.

How do you ensure the quality of the product? How do you ensure the packaging? So that it reaches the place where you sent it from.

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. First of all, we don't use PET or plastic jars. We use glass jars.

Furthermore, to protect the glass from breaking, we have made a special box. It has cushioning, thermocol and some biodegradable materials. We also have a corrugation box in it.

We deliver it to Pan India.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely. So viewers, now we know how easy it is to do business on ONDC. We also learned how to do it.

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. And this information was shared with us by registered seller, Mr. Aditya Bhargav on ONDC. Thank you very much, sir.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you.
